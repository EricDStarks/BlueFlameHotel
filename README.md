In this project, we will be refactoring the existing codebase to implement the concept of dependency injection while keeping the current behavior of the API server unchanged. Dependency injection is a design pattern that promotes loose coupling between components and enhances the modularity and testability of your application. By following this pattern, we aim to make our codebase more maintainable, flexible, and extensible.

Welcome to our app! We want to make sure you know how to use your account. This guide will explain what "User Accounts" are and how to create one, along with pictures to help you every step of the way.

What is a User Account?
A User Account is like your personal space in the app. It's a way for the app to remember who you are and what you can do. Just like you need a key to enter your home, you need a User Account to use certain parts of the app.

Creating Your User Account (User Registration)
Getting Started: When you start using the app, you'll find a button that says "Sign Up" or "Create Account." It's like making your own profile.

Sharing Info: The app will ask you for some basic information, like your name and email. This helps the app recognize you later.

Choosing a Password: You'll create a secret password. This is like your secret code to protect your account.

Confirming Your Email: Sometimes, the app might send you an email to make sure it's really you. You can click a link in the email to show that you own the email you gave.

Using Your User Account (User Login)
Logging In: When you come back to the app, look for a button that says "Log In." It's like opening a locked door with your key.

Your User Key: The app will ask for your "key," which is your username or email, and the secret password you created. This way, the app knows it's really you.

Getting Access: If your key matches the one the app has, it will give you a special "ticket." This ticket lets you do the things you're allowed to do in the app.
